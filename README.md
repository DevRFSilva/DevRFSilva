## Hey, I'm Ricardo Silva! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. I'm a .Net Full Stack Web Developer at EventBuddy.pt and full time adventure seeker. <br />
I'm from Porto, Portugal but I'm currently living in Alicante, Spain.<br />
<br />
Before Web Development, my background was in electrical engineering ðŸ’¡ even though web development has always aroused my interest. In 2020 I decided to take action and make my wish come true. After several months of studying everything by myself, I started looking for a job having found EventBuddy in March 2021, lefted my previous job in November of the same year and moved to Spain. Along the way I learned C#, DotNet, Linq, Git and Unity Testing. <br />
<br />
What a rollercoaster ðŸŽ¢
<br />
### I'm currently learning: React
